The following notebook shows insights about driver's dataset for a mobility as a service company (available here: https://data.world/).

The scope is to use SQL to provide insights about drivers behaviour and other key metrics such as retention and conversion rate.

In the first part, we are going to import the datasets and perform some data manipulation. This is needed to avoid further complications, especially when dealing with dates, as jupyter notebook is based on SQL lite.

In the second part, we are going to focus on the insights.
